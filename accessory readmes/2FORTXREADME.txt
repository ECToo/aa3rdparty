Information:

	Welcome to 2Fort!! This is an incredibly well balanced CTF map that encourages players to use teamwork to overcome their opponents. This map originally appeared in the popular Quake mod "Team Fortress" and has appeared in many other games, most notably the TF clones (ETF, TF2, etc.). This was my first map, and I cannot take credit for most of the brushwork, nor would I, as there were some serious issues that needed to be repaired on my behalf. This has been a great learning experience and I encourage anyone who is interested in mapping to try porting an old map. Enjoy!!

Oh, and don't miss my next map: dm-enforcer
