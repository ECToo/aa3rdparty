DON'T COPY/BASE OFF IT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION , mail thx

Also don't even think about selling it, I don't own the ip which Firebrand comes from, CAPCOM does, so if you try to sell it then i'm not responsible if your arse is in jail.

Oh and i'm also not responsible if your Quake 2 screws up because of a mere mesh and textues.
