Random Info            : This was supposed to be my first map, but after many issues                               it ended up being my second. It is part of a Series I plan                                 on continueing with for quite a while This map was created                                 for Alien Arena 2006 GE, but will most likely work for any                                game based on the Q2 source.

History (Fiction)        : The infinity Complex was discovered by [GM]Roadrge while                                 making his way to meet up with the rest of his clan for the                                next round in the Galaxy Tournament. An Alien Ship had come                             out of nowhere and cut him off. Nobody cuts off Roadrage                                and gets away with it, so he chased after the ship and shot                               it down over a near by planet. He then quickly landed near                                 the crash site to see who would have the balls to cut him                                  off,but the pilot was nowhere to be found. What he did find                             was a metalic structure with an open door way built into the                               side of a cliff. He entered the structure to find the missing                               pilot and instead discovered a large complex, which appears to                             have been used for combat training. After a few hours of                                 searching of with no success, he had to leave in order to                                  make it in time for the next round of tournament. But he                                  made sure to map out the location of this new found planet.                               Since then he has returned many times to find the missing                                 pilot who would dare to cut him off. Roadrage knowsthe                                    unknown pilot still has to be hiding out inside the complex                                  somewhere because the downed ship is still remains in the spot                             where it had crashed. So far he has been unsuccessful in his                              search but is to determind to give up. He has named the                                   planet "The Infinity Complex" due to the fact that the                                     complex seems to go on forever underneath surface of the                                 planet.
