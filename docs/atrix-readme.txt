*** How you use this map ***

just extract all files in your main Alien Arena folder.


*** Other informations ***

that is my 3rd map.
the botnavigationfiles are so configured that the bots capture the flag in ctf mode.

in the year 2008 a guy called Phonix created a beta version of this map. 
He lost the mapsourcefile and he want able to decompile the map. so he wasnt able to finish it. 
Then he left alienarena (not because <this problem ;)  not sure why... however). 
then i had the idea to rebuild the map :)  it isnt a copy (i never wanted copy the map ;)) but it is
a remake which looks simmilar + a ctf version
