THE HOUSE OF CHTHON

By:  GrueTamer

This dark, underground map was built around a lava pit, that once held the mighty Chthon.  Now, he is gone, but the area remains, and the Martians have taken it to be used as an arena.  Now, as a combatant in the same halls once fought in by the brave Ranger, you must take down your opposition to be the king of the Chthon's lair.  Things unseen for many years will be unearthed, areas left untouched will be discovered.  Even without a dramatic paragraph like this, you can defeat your opponents and seize the match.
