Thanks for downloading CTF-Rampage for Alien Arena!

To install this map, simply extract the zip file, and copy the 2 folders inside this zip file, directly into your main alien arena folder. Everything is in the right place already!

To start the map in test mode, open up console in alien arena by pressing the ` key (which is next to your number 1 key at the top) and type "map ctf-rampage" without the quotes.

Note: If you already have DM-Rampage installed, you may run into some "File exists, overwrite?" messages when unzipping. You can choose to overwrite, or to keep the existing file. The map uses the same textures anyway, so no worries :)

Happy Fragging!
