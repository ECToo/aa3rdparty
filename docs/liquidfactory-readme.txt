*** Other informations ***

This is a huge map that offers enough playground for big crowded games on it.
The CTF version has several ways to the flag so you really should work as a team in order to win.
Its design looks like from a science fiction movie. There are futuristic walls, a overall green 
atmoshpere with a lot of acid.
You can find the mapsource on AA3rdParty's SVN ;)
