  and MSYS Basic System
- Start the MSYS shell once, then exit it
-   Extract this one to
  c:\mingw\msys\1.0\home\username
  (if you do this with 7zip, keep the "netradiant-dependencies-mingw32" folder
  name of the contents)
- now download the source from the MSYS shell, if you don't already have it:

  from c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin to the "install" directory
