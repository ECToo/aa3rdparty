<BODY>
<P><PRE>	
The list of people whose contributions resulted in aaRadiant is too huge to list. So rather than 
try I will give a brief history of the development process, sorry to anyone who feels they have 
been unfairly treated.

QuakeEd - The original in house ID Software Quake mapping tool for nextstep.
	|
	|- QE4 - The in house ID Software mapping tool for Quake 2.
	|
	|- QERadiant - Developed by Robert Duffy from the source of QE4
	|
	|- Q3Radiant - ID Software took the QERadiant source in house to create the Quake 3 Arena mapping tool.
	|
	|- GtkRadiant - Forked to include the GTK+ toolkit for linux and mac support.
	|
	|- NetRadiant - Forked by Alientrap to better support Nexuiz and later Xonotic
	|
	|- aaRadiant - Not alot of code was changed from the netradiant source, the project was solely aimed at making mapping 
		       easier for Alien Arena contributors. Thanks Strat for fixing the glib build errors and to [VP]Cheney for 
		       making the awesome splash screen.
