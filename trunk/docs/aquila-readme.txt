---------Some Informations about the map---------

Territory of Aquila is a place in the constellation of Aquila. In the beginning i had different versions of it, but this one was the best. We have two different bases in the CTF version. They have both the same large, but they also have advantages and disadvantages. The gunjump is one of my favorite skills in aa and on this map could it be really useful to use it.There are not really huge differences between the CTF and DM versions. The spawn-points in the DM version are better distributed and we have there some of the special items of aa. Have fun on it!!
