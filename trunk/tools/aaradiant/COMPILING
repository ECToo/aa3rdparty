developer documentation for aaRadiant
=====================================
Note: This is written for aaRadiant, which has been customised for 
Alien Arena. Some game dependent changes may make it unsuitable 
for mapping for other games.

getting the source
==================
The latest source is available from the following repositories.
  
aaRadiant: svn checkout http://aa3rdparty.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/aaradiant aaradiant
NetRadiant: git clone git://git.xonotic.org/xonotic/netradiant.git

Linux(using X-windows)
======================
environment:
- gcc >= version 3.1
- GNU make

dependencies: These are only a guide, some packages may be named differently between distributions.

Debian based systems: sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev libpng12-dev mesa-common-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtkglext1-dev 

Fedora and RPM based systems: su -c 'yum install glib2-devel libxml2-devel libpng-devel mesa-libGL-devel gtk2-devel gtkglext-devel'

build:
run 'make'

run:
Execute 'install/radiant.x86'

OSX(using X-windows)
====================
Let me know whether these instructions still work please Mac users.

environment:
- OS X 10.5 or 10.6
- Xcode developer tools installed (OSX DVD)
- X11 (from the OS X DVD)
- MacPorts or fink installed
- the following packages installed:
  Macports:
    gtkglext pkgconfig glib2-devel libxml2 gtk2 pango atk gettext wget
  Fink:
    gtkglext1 pkgconfig glib2-dev libxml2 gtk+2 gtk+2-dev pango1-xft2-ft219-dev atk1 gettext-dev wget

build:
run 'make'

run:
Switch into the install folder, and run NetRadiant.app

Win32 (2000, XP, Vista or Windows 7)
==================
environment:
- MinGW and Prepackaged Radiant dependencies (Gtk and other stuff):
  http://aa3rdparty.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/aaradiant/windows_build_tools.zip

  Run mingw-get-inst-20111118.exe and install to c:\mingw, and select the components C compiler, C++ compiler
  and MSYS Basic System
- Start the MSYS shell once, then exit it
-   Extract aaradiant-dependencies-mingw32-20101211.zip to
  c:\mingw\msys\1.0\home\username
- Start the MSYS shell and get the source: svn checkout http://aa3rdparty.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/aaradiant aaradiant

build:

- Switch to the directory with aaRadiant source
- make MAKEFILE_CONF=mingw-Makefile.conf

run:
- in the "install" directory, double click netradiant.exe
- if you get a DLL not found error, copy the DLL from either c:\mingw\bin or
  from c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin to the "install" directory

Map Compilers for Linux/OSX
===========================
I suggest using the included compiler source in the utils3 directory, this is
made to work with the build menus. It is not necessary to rebuild these if you 
rebuild aaradiant, changing to the utils3 directory and running 'make install' 
will do the trick.

environment:
- gcc >= version 3.1
- GNU make

build:
run 'make clean all install'
